# KHR_behavior

## Contributors

- Ben Houston, Threekit, @bhouston

## Status

Draft

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Overview

This extension allows a glTF to exhibit dynamic behavior in response to triggers.  This is a step towards creating interchangeable smart metaverse assets.

## Design Goals

This behavioral extension is modelled after Unreal Engine's Blueprints as well as NVIDIA's OmniGraph.  Both of these endeavors are visual scripting systems that give 3D objects "smart"s.
