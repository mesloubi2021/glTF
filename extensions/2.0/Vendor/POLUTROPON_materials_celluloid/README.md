## Overview

Cell shading, also known as cel shading or toon shading, is a common shading effect used in video games and other 3D animation.
The goal of this type of shading is to try to replicate the look of 2D animation.
The name comes from the original media used by 2D animators, being transparent celluloid sheets where animation frames were hand painted.

The characteristic look of celluloid shading is flat colors delimited by hard borders representing highliths, neutral colors, and dark shaded colors.

A common effect added to this are black outlines that is supposed to simulate inked linework on cartoon-style drawing. 

This rendering effect is particularly easy to produce on modern programmable rendering pipelines. The goal of the extension is to provide a simple and configurable definition of a glTF material that represent this kind of shading.
